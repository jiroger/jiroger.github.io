    <p>Heyo! My name's Roger, and I'm from Palo Alto, California.
      Well, kinda--I hopped around a lot when I was younger and spent a few years on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.
      Anyways, after settling down, I attended Henry M. Gunn High School, and now I'm studying computer science at UC San Diego.
      I'll be graduating in 2022 but until then, I'm just living life in the moment.
      <br><br>
      As for some technical stuff, I mainly code in Python, though I've also got experience with Java, C, and JavaScript.
      For those who're interested, <a href="/schedule">here's</a> a list of courses I've taken.

    <p> And yeah! That's kinda it about me. Head on down to the <a href="/fun">Fun Stuff</a> section if you wanna know more about my life outside of academics. Otherwise, happy browsing and have a nice day!
