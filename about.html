    <p>Heyo! My name's Roger, and I'm from Palo Alto, California. Well, kinda--I hopped around a lot when I was younger and spent a few years on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Anyways, after settling down in 5th grade,
      I attended JLS Middle School and then Henry M. Gunn High School, which taught me a thing or two about time management and keeping at least <i> a smidgen </i> of calm when deadlines start piling up.

      I'm expecting to walk across the stage in 2023, though if plans fall through, then I should be on track to graduate with a bachelor's in 2022.

      along with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>. Other languages and frameworks I've worked with include
